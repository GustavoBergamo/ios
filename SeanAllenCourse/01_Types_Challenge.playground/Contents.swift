// Create a variable named theAnswerToEverything of type integer and set its value to 42
var theAnswerToEverything: Int = 42



// Create a variable named pi of type float and set its value to 3.14159265359
var pi: Float = 3.14159265359



// Create a variable named daysInYear of type double and set its value to the length of a year, 365.26 days.
var daysInYear : Double = 365.26



// Using type interfence, create a variable named courseName of type string and set it's value equal to: iOS Dev Launchpad
var courseName: String = "iOS Dev Lauchpad"



// Create a variable named successAwaits of type boolean and set the value to true
var successAwaits: Bool = true



// Run your playground.
//  What happened to the value of pi (the second variable)? it becomes shorter
//  Why? 'Cause float has a small limit
//  What could you do differently to preserve all the digits of pi? change it to double




// Go deeper

// What if you have a string you want to break up into multiple lines?
var name: String = """
David
Carl
Suzi
"""
// Can you search online and find two ways to make a string with more than one line?
var threeLines = "Here's the first line.\nHere's the second line.\nPrint me out to see all three lines."

// Print out your strings to see if they work.
print(name)
print(threeLines)
// (And don't worry if you can't find both methods. You can always check the solution to see how it's done.)
